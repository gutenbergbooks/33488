<h3>WEEK BY WEEK.</h3>

<p>The prevalence of wet weather has had a painful effect on the
aspect of the metropolitan streets. We do not refer so much to their
having been universally inundated with rain, but rather to the absence
from them of those pretty dresses in which it is customary for ladies
to disport themselves during sunny weather. For instance, it was
calculated the other day by a well-known wrangler, that if the tangential
surface of a Bond Street pavement be represented by the
formula:</p> <p class="center2">x(&pi; + y<sup>nth</sup>) = y + x - <sup>&pi;</sup>&frasl;<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">x</span>,</p>
<p>the decrease in the number of pedestrians appearing on a wet day may be set down as
18426&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 0.9em;"><sup>1</sup></span>&frasl;<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">52</span>.</p>

<hr />

<p>A Correspondent calls our attention to the prevalence of green on
the various trees of the Metropolis. "This phenomenon," he
observes, "is noticeable in May and early June every year. Some
trees are greener than others, whilst others scarcely come up to the
standard of leafy verdure displayed by their fellows. Taking the
trees in the Park and arranging them in the inverse ratio of their
distances at rectangular intervals from the common centre of their
growth, it will be found that the surface area of a Plane-tree is
equal to exactly five hundred times the cubic capacity of a gooseberry
bush, measured from a point on its inner circumference."</p>

<hr />

<p>Miss <span class="sc">Robinson</span>, Mrs. <span class="sc">Touche-Arming</span>, and Lady <span class="sc">Cordelia
Crossbit</span>,
were photographed yesterday. We hear that excellent likenesses
of these brilliant ornaments of the Upper Ten have been secured.</p>

<hr />

<p>The wonderful tameness and docility of the three African lions
now going through their daily performance at the French Exhibition
at Earl's Court, have astonished no less than pleased all who have
witnessed them, but it is not generally known, that their obedient
condition is due to their diet. This has for some time consisted of
a well-known infant's and invalid's food, washed down with copious
draughts of a widely advertised patent medicine that claims to act
as "a special brain and nerve tonic," and it is this last that it is
said is responsible for the quenching of the natural ferocity and
utter prostration of spirit which enables their talented trainer,
together with the watchful attentions of a highly intelligent boar-hound,
to put them through a series of playful and innocent tricks,
hitherto associated rather with the entertaining efforts of the skilled
and educated guinea-pig than with the masterly ferocity of the
monarch of the desert. [Oh yes! We're not going to allow an
advertisement to be sneaked in like this. But as we required a paragraph
to fill up space, here it is, with name and address of Infant's
Food provider omitted! Aha!&mdash;<span class="sc">Ed.</span>]</p>

<h3>A WHITE SLAVE.</h3>

<blockquote><p>
[Miss <span class="sc">Harker</span> took service as a day governess in a family at Stockton, at
a salary of 25<i>s.</i> a month, coupled with the privilege of dining in the house.
She found herself under the necessity of taking a lodging, the rent for which
more than absorbed her modest stipend. She taught three children English
and music. Afterwards a couple of infants were placed in her charge. Nor
was this all, for when the servants left, the new governess had "to cook the
dinner, wash the dishes, and clean the knives." After this she asked for a
holiday, the result being that "she was shown the door." Thereupon she
brought an action in the County Court for a month's salary in lieu of notice.
Judgment for plantiff with costs, payable forthwith.</p>
<p class="author">&mdash;<i>Daily News, June 12.</i>]
</p></blockquote>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Poor Miss <span class="sc">Harker</span> went to Stockton, to Stockton on the Tees,</p>
<p>But not to make her fortune, or to loll at home at ease;</p>
<p>She went to be a governess, and hoped, it would appear,</p>
<p>To board and lodge and dress herself on £15 a-year.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>A lady once informed us how a lady can be dressed</p>
<p>As a lady all for £15, and in her very best;</p>
<p>But she never would have ventured to include in her account</p>
<p>The lodgings and the breakfasts too for this immense amount.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Now life may be a river, as Pactolus was of old,</p>
<p>Which brings you lots of water to a minimum of gold,</p>
<p>But sometimes it were better, when the water sinks so low</p>
<p>That it fails to turn your mill-wheel, if the river ceased to flow.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>So all day long with urchins three Miss <span class="sc">Harker</span> toiled in chains,</p>
<p>And she poured the oil of learning well upon their rusty brains,</p>
<p>And she practised them in music, and she polished up their sense</p>
<p>With the adverbs and the adjectives, and verbs in mood and tense.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>And they said, "She's doing nicely, we will give her something more</p>
<p>(Not of money, but of labour) ere we show her to the door,</p>
<p>Why, we've got two baby children, it is really only fair</p>
<p>That Miss <span class="sc">Harker</span> should look after them, and wash and dress the pair.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>"And, Miss <span class="sc">Harker</span>, it will save us such a lot of trouble too,</p>
<p>If, when our servants leave us, they can leave their work to you.</p>
<p>So you'll please to cook our dinner, let your motto be <i>Ich Dien</i>,</p>
<p>(No, no, you needn't thank us) and you'll keep our dishes clean.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>"And, of course, you'll do it daily&mdash;what was that you dared to say?</p>
<p>You would like to rest a week or so, and want a holiday?</p>
<p>Who ever heard such nonsense? Well, there's one thing we can show,</p>
<p>Not politeness, but the door to you&mdash;Miss H. you'd better go."</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>So she went, but brought her action, and I'm thankful to relate</p>
<p>That when the case was argued she hadn't long to wait.</p>
<p>"Costs and judgment for the plaintiff, the defendants' case is fudge,</p>
<p>Pay her monthly wage, she's earned it and deserves it," said the Judge.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>There be Englishmen in England, sleek men, and women too,</p>
<p>Who tie their purse-strings tighter than tradition's grasping Jew.</p>
<p>What care they for fellow-feeling, who for profit try to lure</p>
<p>Fellow creatures to their grindstone for the faces of the poor?</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>And they set some wretched slave to work her fingers to the bone,</p>
<p>Then sullenly deny her bread, or give at best a stone;</p>
<p>And after she has grubbed and scrubbed, they insolently sneer</p>
<p>At one who dares to ask for rest on £15 a-year.</p>

moon, spoon, stroll, study, work or play, and, if in your boat, smoke,
for the pernicious weed is forbidden in the well-kept gardens, though
it may be indulged in on the water, beneath whose surface another
pernicious weed can be seen luxuriating.</p>

<p>Once more I visit the A. D. C., and witness a capital performance
of a burlesque, <i>Der Freischütz</i>, founded on one of <span class="sc">H. J. Byron's</span>,
and written up to date by a precious <span class="sc">Stone</span>. Burlesque is not dead!
Very far from it. The "Sacred Lamp" is not even flickering, but
burning with undiminished brilliancy. For a time learned Thebans
essayed to extinguish it with High Comedy and even Shakspearian
Drama. But the A. D. C. was meant for recreation, and no Undergraduate
saw any amusement in either performing or witnessing
High Comedy or an historical Drama by <span class="sc">William Shakspeare</span>.
Relaxation for the pale student was needed, so dancing and singing,
and jokes, topical hits, and comic business, drew big houses,
and amused both players and audiences. The classical Puritanical
rebellion was over, and the Merry Monarch, King Burlesque, was
restored to his throne, merrier than ever. A crowded house, and I
am informed crowdeder and crowdeder every night.</p>

<p>The burlesque is a good one, as the story of <i>Der Freischütz</i> is
closely parodied, and it is not a mere variety show. And the actors
are as much in earnest as the other actors were in earnest, terrible
earnest, just thirty-five years ago, for the date over the proscenium
reminds me that the A. D. C. was founded in 1855. There are some
old original members down here, and they regard some old original
photographs of themselves when they were all boys together in this
A. D. C. The photographs are of beardless youths, all very much in
earnest. The middle-aged, grey-bearded men are contemplating
their former selves with an air of surprise. "Dear me! and those
were us!" they exclaim, in Academical English. They see themselves
as others saw them then, and they are secretly disappointed,
though they soon recover their serenity, and with pride
to think their lineaments have been preserved and handed down
from generation to generation, they bring up their wives and
daughters to look at the pictures, and to listen to their "tales of a
grandfather."</p>

<p>Alas! the photographs are fading, and soon, but for the extant
history of the A. D. C., dedicated to its Honorary President, H.R.H.,
the Prince of <span class="sc">Wales</span>, its origin would be lost in the obscurity of
the dark ages (before they were the grey ages), or be so confused
and intermingled with myth as to render any account of its early
days untrustworthy.</p>

<p>And what a crowd, driving, walking, riding, to see the boat-races!
Quite a little Water Derby Day. So much talk about "bumps," that
a stranger would think he had come to hear an open-air lecture on
phrenology.</p>

<p>One more lounge in the "Backs," and then to London and work,
while happy Undergrads commence their Long Vacation, and make
holiday in the sunshine of life. But roam where you will, never
will you find any spot to equal these Backs. <i>O Fortunati Cantabiles!</i>
<i>Backs vobiscum!</i></p>

<p>As a barrister I love a refresher, and this flying visit has, indeed,
been a refresher to one who drinks to Trin. Coll. Cam. and the
A. D. C. in a bumper of '75 Margaux, and is able, after that, to
sign himself, academically and Lincolnsinnically, the</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<h4>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h4>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, June 9.</i>&mdash;Last time I saw <span class="sc">Old
Morality</span> was in the lovely estuary of the Dart. He had just cut
away from Parliament, called together his seamen bold, and steamed
out Westward in the <i>Pandora</i>. When we on the <i>Hiawatha</i> woke
up on Sunday morning, there was the <i>Pandora</i> lying alongside, with
<span class="sc">Old Morality</span> in pea-jacket, straw hat, telescope under his arm,
and sea-boots above his knees, though there was not a ripple on face
of water that mirrored the old castle at the point, the church, the
trees, and the green hills. Nevertheless, there he was, pacing the
mizzen-deck, every now and then bringing his telescope to his
weather eye, on the look out for Irish Members or <span class="sc">Sage of Queen
Anne's Gate</span> lurking in underwood. We ran up at our foretopmost
peak, all taut by a couple of bowlines, the signal, "England expects
that <span class="sc">W. H. Smith</span> this day will do his duty." There was a soft
gleam in <span class="sc">Old Morality's</span> starboard eye when he recognised the
signal, and he brought the telescope to the salute.</p>

<p>"Very kind of you, <span class="sc">Toby</span>; very thoughtful of your Commodore.
You know, nothing is nearer to my heart than the desire to do my
duty&mdash;duty to my <span class="sc">Queen</span> and Country; at the same time, of course
as far as is compatible with the supreme incentive, desiring to meet
the convenience of Hon. Gentlemen in all parts of the House."</p>

<p>Haven't seen <span class="sc">Old Morality</span> since, till he turned up to-night,
Been seedy, everybody sorry to hear; judiciously added a week to
his regular holiday. When he entered House this afternoon, good
rattling cheer went up, testifying to his popularity.</p>

<p>"Yes," said <span class="sc">Wilfrid Lawson</span>, dropping into poetry&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Ex-First-Lord from over the sea!</p>
<p>Celt, Home-Ruler, whatever we be,</p>
<p>"We all like <span class="sc">Old Morali-tee</span>."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Irish Land Purchase Bill first Order of day, but <span class="sc">John Dillon</span> moves
Adjournment, to discuss goings on of Police in Tipperary. <span class="sc">Prince
Arthur</span>, amidst constant
interruptions, makes angry
reply. His speech introduces
variation on old Constitutional
principle.</p>

 <div class="figleft" style="width:200px;"><a href="images/292-600.png"><img src="images/292-200.png" width="200" height="302" alt="The Chairman of P. and O. after Remark" /></a>
 <p class="center">The Chairman of P. and O. after Remark
from Mr. O'Brien.</p></div>

<p>"The Police," he says in
effect, "can do no wrong&mdash;at
least, in Ireland."</p>

<p>Mr. G. joins in demands
for Parliamentary inquiry.
<span class="sc">William O'Brien</span>, almost
hoarse with rage, fulminates
against <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span>
and all his works.
But though apparently
seethed in passion, does not
lose presence of mind.</p>

<p>"I know," he shouted,
"every Dissentient Liberal
in this House," (here his
copy of the Orders, which
he had fashioned in rough
shape resembling police
baton, and flourished in
dangerous fashion, came
down with enormous thud
on crown of hat of <span class="sc">Tom
Sutherland</span>, who happened
to be sitting just beneath
him) "&mdash;and that's
one," <span class="sc">O'Brien</span> continued.</p>

<p>"Surely," I said to him
afterwards, "you didn't mean to call attention to the Chairman of
the P. and O. in that fashion?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it. I was going to say, 'I know every Dissentient
Liberal in this House will support the Government in the Division
Lobby;' but when in the middle of the sentence I found I'd come
down on <span class="sc">Sutherland's</span> hat, I thought it would make less fuss if I
turned the remark in the way I left it."</p>

<p>Ingenious this; but <span class="sc">Sutherland</span> says, he understands now why
many of the Irish Members are accustomed to wear low-crowned
hats during Parliamentary Debate. Comes a little expensive to sit
about listening with a silk hat on.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Land Purchase Bill in Committee.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Grandolph's</span> seat empty. Not been here since House
resumed after Whitsun holidays. Looked for to-night. Has first
place on Orders with Instruction on going into Committee on Compensation
Bill. <span class="sc">Speaker</span> been going about with a besom brushing
away Instructions. Only <span class="sc">Grandolph's</span> stands, a monument to his
adroitness and ingenuity. Opposition looking forward to pleasant
evening. If <span class="sc">Grandolph</span> makes rattling speech in support of his
Instruction, it will make things disagreeable for the Ministry.
Moment comes, but <span class="sc">Grandolph</span> lingers. Cousin <span class="sc">Curzon</span> gets up,
announces that <span class="sc">Grandolph</span> has heard that Government intend to
oppose the Instruction. That being so, he does not think it expedient,
in interests of public business, to persevere with it. So will
stay in Paris, look through the Luxembourg, loiter in the Louvre,
lunch in the Eiffel Tower, and otherwise innocently wile the hours
away.</p>

<p>"No," said Cousin <span class="sc">Curzon</span>, when I observed that this was not like
the <span class="sc">Grandolph</span> of old times; "he is much altered; as meek as he
was once aggressive. Shudders at the thought of causing a moment's
inconvenience to a Government of which <span class="sc">Georgie Hamilton</span> is an
ornament; quite surprised to learn that Government would oppose
Amendment, the carrying of which would be equivalent to defeat of
their measure. When he heard of it at once decided to drop his
Instruction."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;In Committee on Compensation Bill.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;House sitting; Members talking; Bills advanced
by stages; but thoughts of Members concentrated on secret <span class="sc">Old
Morality</span> carries in his placid bosom. What proposals are Government
going to make for arrangement of public business? Are they
going to drop three Bills, or two, or one, or carry all three? If so,
how is it to be done? by Autumn Session? by peremptory Closure?
or by new device of carrying over measures into succeeding
Session? Over a cup of five-o'clock, taken in his private room, I
frankly put these questions to <span class="sc">Old Morality</span>. No use beating about
the bush when you are with old friends.</p>

<p>"<span class="sc">Toby</span>," he says, as I light another cigarette, and settle myself
to hear the disclosure, "recent morphological inquiry has a curious
bearing on this point. Biologists have lately been busy discussing
the meaning of a certain organ, to which, in the present stage of its
development, it appears impossible to assign any utilitarian value.
The case I allude to is the electric organ in the tail of the skate,
on which Professor <span class="sc">Cossar Ewart</span> read a paper before the Royal
Society. You will find a full report of it in <i>Phil. Trans.</i>, Vol.
LXXIX. Other aquatic animals which possess such organs use
them to advantage as electric batteries against their foes. They
feel impelled to do so, by what I may perhaps distantly allude to as
a sense of duty to their <span class="sc">Queen</span> and Country. But the electric organ
of the skate, though a most complicated mechanism, a structure as
elaborate as any in the animal kingdom, appears to be of no benefit
whatever to its possessor. This is a very curious thing. I can hardly
sleep of nights thinking about it. Can you suggest any explanation?
Excuse me, there's the division-bell. Perhaps you'll draw
me up a little memorandum giving me your views on the subject."</p>

<p>Very curious indeed. I hadn't mentioned the skate; don't quite
see how he slided into the subject. Shall take another opportunity
of ascertaining <span class="sc">Old Morality's</span> views and intentions with respect
to Government plan for arranging business.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;As to electric organ in the tail of the skate.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;A pretty kettle-of-fish. Electric organ of skate seems
to have touched up Government; confusion at Carlton to-day. The
<span class="sc">Markiss</span> met his merry men; proposed that Bills not completed by
Prorogation should be carried over to next Session and taken up
at stage reached this year. Loud outcry in Conservative ranks;
proposal denounced as revolutionary; wouldn't have it on any
terms; meeting broke up without passing any resolution; <span class="sc">Old
Morality</span> due at House at half-past three to give notice of Resolutions
on Procedure.</p>

<p>"Where are they?" Mr. G. asks, beaming across the table.</p>

<p>"Resolutions?" says <span class="sc">Old Morality</span>; "bless you, Sir, I have
none to move."</p>

<p>Grim silence on Ministerial Benches. Jubilation in Opposition
camp. <span class="sc">Old Morality</span> plied with questions from all sides; forlornly
shakes his head. Can't say anything now. Can't say when he will
be able to say something. Perhaps on Monday; perhaps some
other day. Baited for half an hour, and then mercifully allowed
to escape.</p>

<p>"The tail seems, after all, to have been wagging the skate," I
said, humorously; really sorry to find him so low-spirited. Didn't
seem to see the point of joke, and usually so apt at badinage. A
curious state of affairs; perhaps a memorable day.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;In Committee on Compensation Bill.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;"Lo! a strange thing has happened." (<span class="sc">W. Black.</span>)
Yesterday Conservatives in open revolt; Ministry seemed tottering;
Opposition jubilant. To-day things righted themselves; the rebels
say it was only their fun; Dissentient Liberals throw arms round
neck of <span class="sc">Markiss</span>; protest they would never desert him; Opposition
depressed; Ministers elate.</p>

<p>"The head seems to have got the better of the complicated
mechanism in the rear of the skate," I say to <span class="sc">Old Morality</span>, a
little timidly, remembering failure of yesterday's flash of humour.
Quick comes the beaming smile. "You're a funny dog, <span class="sc">Toby</span>,"
says <span class="sc">Old Morality</span>, looking ten years younger than yesterday.</p>

<h3>AT HIS MAYERJESTY'S.</h3>

<p><i>Paris Fin de Siècle</i>, Mr. <span class="sc">Mayer's</span> second transplantation from the
Gymnase to Her Majesty's Theatre, is amusing from first to last&mdash;that
is to say, from 8·15 to close on midnight. The Comedy rattles<!-- middot? -->
along, and carries the audience who understand French&mdash;who in
their turn carry the audience who pretend to do so, but who don't&mdash;with
it. The acting is excellent; and the dialogue is as bright as the
looks and toilettes of the dozen or more ladies who have parts. It is
not quite clear what "<i>fin de siècle</i>" means. If it is Paris of
to-day that is pictured, it
certainly cannot be the Paris of five years hence, and the century
has yet ten years to run. But whatever is the purpose of the play, it
satisfied the audience which, on the first night, included H.R.H. and
the <span class="sc">Princess of Wales</span>, together with "all London."</p>

<p>The plot is simple. <i>Alfred de Mirandol</i> (M. <span class="sc">Noblet</span>), of the
<i>tout
Paris</i> set, is engaged to the daughter of the <i>Marquis de
Boissy-Godet</i>&mdash;so
he tells everyone who chances to be breakfasting at
<span class="sc">Bignon's</span>, where the first scene is laid&mdash;and, without anything
particular happening to either of them during the next three Acts,
he remains engaged to the young lady when the curtain falls. Then
he has a <i>non fin de siècle</i> friend, fresh from Brittany, who proposes
to a charming widow, charmingly looked and played by Madame
<span class="sc">Sisos</span>, who accepts him, and lands him in a duel with a Spanish
Duke (cleverly played by M. <span class="sc">Paul Plan</span>) about her Milliner's bill.
No one is hurt, but the incident&mdash;the only incident to speak of&mdash;furnishes
a scene in which the four <i>fin de siècle</i> seconds are continually
forgetting the business on which they are met, and drift into baccarat.
Then Madame <span class="sc">Desclauzas</span> is a Marquise who is so busy with her
various charitable institutions that she has not seen her husband for
a week, and forgets all about her daughter's marriage.</p>

<p>To London 1890 the Marquise, though unquestionably inimitable,
seems slightly loud. English Marchionesses do not as a rule wink.
But <i>Paris Fin de Siècle</i> is altogether beyond London 1890. English
people do not know enough of the formalities attending the arrangement
of duels to fully appreciate M. <span class="sc">Noblet's</span> forgetfulness of his
duties; nor do English ladies, as yet, give Harlequin Balls, at which
the gentlemen wear red evening coats,&mdash;it was not a hunt-ball of
course; nor does London 1890 see any particular point in the <i>monde</i>
being shown as frivolous and dissipated, while the <i>demi-monde</i> will
not permit smoking in the drawing-room, and generally plays propriety.
So <i>Paris Fin de Siècle</i> may be true to nature, for all English
people know about it. Whether it is or is not, it is just as amusing,
and well worth seeing.</p>

<h3>THE OPERA-GOER'S DIARY.</h3>

<p><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;<i>Les Huguenots.</i> Madame <span class="sc">Nordica</span> as our
<i>Valentine</i>. She
is <i>toujours riante</i>. Otherwise, vocally, charming. <span class="sc">Ravelli</span> the
Reliable
as <i>Raoul</i>, much applauded and quite two inches higher in popular
estimation. <i>Valentina</i> <span class="sc">Nordica</span> cannot take anything seriously.
She smiles as she is wont to smile at the supreme moment of his great
athletic window-jump, when he is shot out of window and killed so
thoroughly that he cannot be produced for the last Act of all, which,
therefore, is now never given. Simple-minded folk, not up to this,
wait in their stalls, and wonder why everybody else is going. Members
of orchestra disappear, lights extinguished, brown-holland coverings
descend, the fireman enters, the box-keepers retire, and suddenly it
bursts upon the inexperienced Opera-goer that it's all over, except
shouting for carriages, and that's over too by now, and that there is
to be no more Opera to-night.</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>L'entr'acte est long,</p>
<p class="i2">Un peu d'espoir,</p>
<p>There's no more song,</p>
<p class="i2">Et puis bon soir.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>M. <span class="sc">Lassalle</span> as the French nobleman, whom some one described as
"<i>Sam Bris</i>," excellent. Good house for the <i>Huguenots</i>.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Here we are <i>Lohengrinning</i> again. <i>Lohengrin</i> not
a comic opera: the name being rather misleading. Melodious,
mellifluous Mlle. <span class="sc">Melba</span> as <i>Elsa de Brabante</i>. <span class="sc">Ned de
Reszké</span>
as the <i>Great King</i>, <span class="sc">Fursch-Madi-gras</span> unrivalled as
<i>Ortruda</i>,
<span class="sc">Dan Drady</span> as <i>Freddy</i>, one of his most dramatic performances;
Signor <span class="sc">Abramoff</span> as the <i>Family Herald</i>&mdash;quite a volume&mdash;and
<span class="sc">Jack de Reszké</span> as a <i>Knight on the Swannee River</i>, or perhaps
a knightly visitor from Swansea. Poor <span class="sc">Jack</span> suffering from hoarseness.
<span class="sc">Druriolanus</span> comes forward to explain this. Audience
imagines that <span class="sc">Druriolanus</span> himself is going to take poor <span class="sc">Jack's</span>
place.
Rather disappointed in consequence. "Could have done it, of
course," says <span class="sc">Druriolanus</span> afterwards, "but bad example for other
members of the governing committee." <span class="sc">Jack de R.'s</span> hoarseness
scarcely noticeable. No one would have known it if <span class="sc">Druriolanus</span>
hadn't told us. Some people can't keep a secret.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;<i>Vide</i> last Wednesday's report. Only difference being
that Signor <span class="sc">Plunketto Greeno</span> is not <i>in statu quo ante</i>, the part
of
the <i>Commendatore, M.P. for Stony Stratford</i>, being taken by
Signor <span class="sc">De Vaschetti</span>.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Missed it. <i>Romeo et Juliette.</i> Believe it was performed,
not having heard anything to contrary. Reported that Mr.
and Mrs. G. were present. Remember he was there last season,
when same Opera was played. Came up then, I think, from Dollis
Hill. "All roads lead to Romeo," the G.O.M. is reported to have
said to <span class="sc">Floral Hall</span>, the Covent Gardenia Box Office Manager and
enthusiastic devotee of the G.O.M., or "Grand Opera Man."</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;<i>La Favorite</i> in French. Evidently neither particular
nor universal Favourite, as so many <i>habitués</i>, conspicuous when
here by their noble presence, are now still more conspicuous by their
noble absence. Mlle. <span class="sc">Richard</span>, her first visit to Royal Franco-Italian
Opera at Covent Garden, is the Favourite to-night, and the
Favourite wins. Opportunity for Mlle. <span class="sc">Bauermeister</span>, who has
one of the prettiest airs in the Opera to start with, but then "is
heard no more," having only to exhibit, in sympathetic dramatic
action, her deep distress at the sufferings of the unhappy Favourite,
the victim of <i>Alfonse</i>, King of Castille. <i>King Alfonse</i> gives a
garden-party, with "gipsy revellers" of the period, led by small
and early <span class="sc">Palladino</span>. Refreshments are probably served in an
adjoining apartment, but <i>King Alfonse</i>, being, perhaps, a trifle
dry, occupies his time in the chair of state by trifling with a lozenge.
Great difficulty among audience as to whether <i>Fernand</i> is
<span class="sc">Montariol</span>
or <span class="sc">Ybos</span>. Having seen <span class="sc">Montariol</span> as <i>David</i> in the
<i>Meistersingers</i>,
I do not recognise him as Fernand; but having seen <span class="sc">Ybos</span> as
<i>Raoul</i>,
in the <i>Huguenots</i>, <span class="sc">Fernand's</span> legs seem familiar to me. If the
voice is the voice of <span class="sc">Montariol</span>, the legs are the legs of <span class="sc">Ybos.
Druriolanus Iboss</span> says it is <i>not</i> <span class="sc">Ybos</span> but
<span class="sc">Montariol</span>; while a
distinguished Operatic Committeeman tells a despairing critic that it
<i>is</i> <span class="sc">Ybos</span>, and not <span class="sc">Montariol</span>. Anyhow, Mons.
<span class="sc">Ybos-aux-jambes-montarioliennes</span>
is a good, though not great, <i>Fernand</i>. The chorus
whether as Monks of one of the great Theatrical Orders,
not-admitted-after-seven,
or as members of the Castilian Aristocracy, are admirable.
Signor <span class="sc">Gaspar</span>&mdash;a name that suggests a singer rather out
of condition, and, like <i>Hamlet</i>, "scant of breath" (he should
be appropriately attired in "pants")&mdash;keeps his eye on Signor
<span class="sc">Bevignani</span>, and Signor <span class="sc">Bevignani</span> pulls him through. <i>Mem.</i>
What an education in modern languages it must require to be a
chorister of the R. I. O. C. G.! Italian, French, English, of course;
and perhaps one night they'll come out with something of <span class="sc">Wagner's</span>
in the original German. Everybody looking forward to the revival
of <i>Le Prophète</i> on Monday next.</p>

<p><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;<i>Non adsum</i>, because 'ad sum-where else to go. Covent
Garden, however, not closed in consequence. Hear that <span class="sc">Jean</span> is
to get £600 per week in America. Good interest this for one tenner.</p>

<h2>LE 'OCKEY STICK-BALLE FIGHT.</h2>

<h4><i>Contributed by Our Own "Sportings-Life" Man.</i></h4>

<p class="ind1"><span class="sc">Mon Cher Monsieur Punch,</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">I know</span> what interest profound and
gracious you have always manifested towards
the glorious efforts of the heroic youth of
our regenerated athletic France, for have I
not read your notices amiable and scientific of
<i>les</i> "doings" of our onze at the <i>jeu de
Cricquette</i>, and still later of the murderous
combat of the veritable "struggle-for-lifers"
in <i>le scrimmage</i> of your terrible contest of
"Kicke-balle"? But now the valiant youth
of our public seminaries have advanced still
one more step, and the afternoon of last
Tuesday saw, in the leafy arcades of our Bois,
a true "stick-balle" fight&mdash;in one word, a
<i>parti</i> of "Le 'Ockey," played with <i>vrais
bâtons</i>, clubs long and terrible, with cruel
hooked finish, to the eye of the beholder, and
the dangerous white ball, hard as iron, heavy
as lead, between a 'ome team and a "side"
of strangers, that would have done credit to
an "Oxfor-Cambridge" battle or a fight
royal, in which <i>Les Roverres de Peckham</i>
were themselves engaged.</p>

<p>The costume of the <i>'ome team</i>, of which I
was the General, consisting, as it did, of
"knickerbockerres" of pink velvet, jerseys
of green and yellow satin in stripes, padded
in front and behind, as a protection from <i>les
coups de les "stickes,"</i> with large feather
pillows, and 'igh jack-boots, worn with the
same motive, completed, together with a
massive iron and wire mask, surmounted
with a funereal plume, used to safeguard the
head and neck, a costume at once striking
and useful. The strangers were, perhaps,
not quite so happily arranged, their legs being
encased in chain-armour, and their bodies
protected by large wicker clothes-washing-baskets;
but, though this precautionary costume
hampered in some respect the play of
their arms, and impeded their swiftness in
making "le rush," still, the hardest blow of
the death-dealing "stickes" fell on them
without pain, and they could meet the approach
of the terrible iron-lead ball without
the apprehensive tremblings of terror.</p>

<p>The contest, though fierce, was not of long
duration, for, after the ninth goal, the iron-lead
ball was driven with such furious <i>élan</i>
by the victorious side that it dashed into the
middle of the spectators, and was swallowed, in
the excitement, by the startled horse of an omnibus.
Thereupon the Umpire, being appealed
to, decided the contest terminated with victory,
by three goals to nothing, to the 'ome team,
and amidst the prolonged "hurrahs" of the
assembled thousands, who represented all the
<i>élite</i> of the veritable 'igh and Sporting life of
the best Parisian Society, the first day's
<i>stick-balle</i> fight that has now introduced "Le
'Ockey" into the arena of our rising National
Athletics, came to a brilliant and inspiriting
end. I beg you, <i>Mon cher Monsieur Punch</i>,
be assured of my highest considerations, as I
subscribe myself your very humble <i>serviteur</i>,</p>

"Duty to consist of eight hours (in one shift)
out of <i>every</i> twenty-four."

<p>The words in brackets are a puzzle. Is
"shift" a misprint for "shirt"? Is a Policeman
now compelled to wear more than one of
these in every twenty-four hours? Is it
flannel or linen? We confess that we do not

<p><i>The Descriptive Man</i>. They've got both the fences up now, d'ye

got a ticket with his number on his back. See? The first man's horse
don't seem to care about jumping this
afternoon&mdash;see how he's dancing
about. Now he's going at it&mdash;there,
he's cleared it! Now he'll have to
jump the next one!</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Keeps up a running fire of these

<p><i>The Judge of Horseflesh.</i> Rare good
shoulders that one has.</p>

<p><i>The Severe Critic (taking the remark
to apply to the horse's rider).</i>
H'm, yes&mdash;rather&mdash;pity he sticks his
elbows out quite so much, though.</p>

<p><i>The S. S.</i> They'll be plenty 'oigh enough fur some on 'em.</p>

<p><i>The Severe Critic.</i> Ugly seat that fellow has&mdash;all anyhow when

<p><i>Judge of Horseflesh.</i> Has he? I didn't notice&mdash;I was looking at
the horse.</p>
<p class="right1"> [<i>Severe Critic feels snubbed.</i></p>

<p><i>The Cockney Groom.</i> 'Ere's a little bit o' fashion coming down
next&mdash;why, there's quite a boy on his back.</p>

<p><i>The S. S.</i> 'E won't be on 'im long if he don't look out. Cup an'

<p><i>The Morbid Man.</i> I suppose there's always a accident o' some
sort before they've finished.</p>

<p><i>First Woman.</i> Oh, don't, for goodness sake, talk like that&mdash;I'm
sure <i>I</i> don't want to see nothing 'appen.</p>

<p><i>Second Woman.</i> Well, you may make your mind easy&mdash;for you
won't see nothing here; you <i>would</i> have it this was the best place to
come to!</p>

<p><i>First Woman.</i> I only said there was no sense in paying extra for
the balcony, when you can go in the area for nothing.</p>

<p><i>Second Woman (snorting).</i> Area, indeed! It might be a good deal
airier than what it is, I'm sure&mdash;I shall melt if I stay here
much longer.</p>

<p><i>The Morbid Man.</i> There's one thing about being so close to the
jump as this&mdash;if the 'orse jumps sideways&mdash;as 'osses will do every now
and then&mdash;he'll be right in among us before we know where we are,
and then there'll be a pretty how-de-do!</p>

<p><i>Second Woman (to her Friend).</i> Oh, come away, do&mdash;it's bad
enough to see nothing, let alone having a great 'orse coming down
atop of us, and me coming out in my best bonnet, too&mdash;come away!</p>

<p class="right">[<i>They leave.</i></p>

<p><i>The Descriptive Man.</i> Now they're going to make 'em do some in-and-out
jumping, see? they're putting the fences close together&mdash;that'll
puzzle some of them&mdash;ah, he's over both of 'em; very
clean that one jumps! Over again! He's got to do it all twice,
you see.</p>

<p><i>The Judge of Horseflesh.</i> Temperate horse, that chestnut.</p>

<p><i>The Severe Critic.</i> Is he, though?&mdash;but I suppose they <i>have</i> to be
here, eh? Not allowed champagne or whiskey or anything before
they go in&mdash;like they are on a racecourse?</p>

<p><i>The J. of H.</i> No, they insist on every horse taking the pledge
before they'll enter him.</p>

<p><i>The Descriptive Man.</i> Each of 'em's had a turn at the in-and-out
jump now. What's coming next? Oh, the five-barred gate&mdash;they're
going over that now, and the stone wall&mdash;see them putting
the bricks on top? That's to <i>raise</i> it.</p>

<p><i>The Morbid Man.</i> None of 'em been off yet; but (<i>hopefully</i>)
there'll be a nasty fall or two over this business&mdash;there's been many
a neck broke over a lower gate than that.</p>

<p class="ind1"><i>A Competitor clears the gate easily, holding the reins casually
in his right hand.</i></p>

<p><i>The J. of H.</i> That man can ride.</p>

<p><i>The Severe Critic.</i> Pretty well&mdash;not what I call <i>business</i>,
though&mdash;going
over a gate with one hand, like that.</p>

<p><i>The J. of H.</i> Didn't know you were such an authority.</p>

<p><i>The S. C. (modestly).</i> Oh, I can tell when a fellow has a good seat.
I used to ride a good deal at one time. Don't get the chance much
now&mdash;worse luck!</p>

<p><i>The J. of H.</i> Well, I can give you a chance, as it happens.
(Severe Critic <i>accepts with enthusiasm, and the inward reflection that
the chance is much less likely to come off than he is himself</i>.) You
wait till the show is over, and they let the horses in for exercise. I
know a man who's got a cob here&mdash;regular little devil to go&mdash;bucks
a bit at times&mdash;but you won't mind that. I'll take you round to the
stall, and get my friend to let you try him on the tan. How will that
do you, eh?</p>

<p><i>The Severe Critic (almost speechless with gratitude).</i> Oh&mdash;er&mdash;it
would do me right enough&mdash;capital! That is&mdash;it would, if I hadn't an
appointment, and had my riding things on, and wasn't feeling rather
out of sorts, and hadn't promised to go home and take my wife in the
Park, and it's her birthday, too, and, then, I've long made it a rule
never to mount a strange horse, and&mdash;er&mdash;so you understand how it
is, don't you?</p>

<p><i>The J. of H.</i> Quite, my dear fellow. (<i>As, for that matter, he has
done from the first.</i>)</p>

<p><i>The Cockney Groom (alluding to a man who is riding at the gate).</i>
'Ere's a rough 'un this bloke's on! (<i>Horse rises at gate; his rider
shouts, "Hoo, over!" and the gate falls amidst general derision.</i>)
Over? Ah, I should just think it was over!</p>

<p><i>The Saturnine Stableman (as horseman passes).</i> Yer needn't ha'
"Hoo"'d for that much!</p>

<p class="ind1">[<i>The Small Boy, precariously perched on an immense animal,
follows; his horse, becoming unmanageable, declines the
gate, and leaps the hurdle at the side.</i></p>

<p><i>The S. S.</i> Ah, you're a <i>artful</i> lad, you are&mdash;thought you'd take
it where it was easiest, eh?&mdash;you'll 'ev to goo back and try agen,
you will.</p>

<p><i>Chorus of Sympathetic Bystanders.</i> Take him at it again, boy;
you're all right!... Hold him in tighter, my lad.... Let out
your reins a bit! Lor, they didn't ought to let a boy like that ride....
He ain't no more 'old on that big 'orse than if he was a fly on
him!... Keep his 'ed straighter next time.... Enough to try a
boy's nerve! &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p class="ind1">[<i>The Boy takes the horse back, and eventually clears the gate
amidst immense and well-deserved applause.</i></p>

<p><i>The Morbid Man (disappointed).</i> Well, I fully expected to see 'im
took off on a shutter.</p>

<p><i>The Descriptive Man.</i> It's the water-jump next&mdash;see; that's it
in the middle; there's the water, underneath the hedge; they'll
have to clear the 'ole of that&mdash;or else fall in and get a wetting.
They've taken all the horses round to the other entrance&mdash;they'll
come in from that side directly.</p>

<p class="ind1">[<i>One of the Judges holds up his stick as a signal; wild shouts of
"Hoy-hoy! Whorr-oosh!" from within, as a Competitor
dashes out and clears hedge and ditch by a foot or two.
Deafening applause. A second horseman rides at it, and
lands&mdash;if the word is allowable&mdash;neatly in the water. Roars
of laughter as he scrambles out.</i></p>

<p><i>The Morbid Man.</i> Call that a brook! It ain't a couple of inches
deep&mdash;it's more mud than water! No fear (<i>he means, "no hope"</i>)
of any on 'em getting a ducking over that!</p>

<p class="ind1">[<i>And so it turns out; the horses take the jump with more or less
success, but without a single saddle being vacated. The
Judges award a red and blue rosette to the riders of the best
and second horses respectively, and the proceedings terminate
for the afternoon amidst demonstrations of hearty satisfaction
from all but</i> The Morbid Man, <i>who had expected there
would have been "more to see.</i>"</p>
